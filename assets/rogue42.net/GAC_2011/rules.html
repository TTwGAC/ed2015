You must present a signed waiver form and confirm any appropriate personal information before you will be allowed to participate in the game. In order to expedite check-in, please have your signed waiver forms with you. Waiver forms will be available wherever you see references to the waiver form.<br>
<br>
<b>1.7 Excuses, Excuses (or, "But...but...") <br></b>
Unless you have something in writing from Game Control, there are no exceptions. Whining is treason. <br>
<br>
<font size=5><u><b>2. Safety<br></b></u></font>
<br>
<b>2.1 Don't Be Stupid <br></b>
Get-a-Clue is meant to be a fun experience for all involved. It's no fun if anyone gets hurt. Remember to be aware of traffic when in your car, aware of your surroundings when running around town, and generally careful at all times. Safety comes first.<br>
<br>
<b>2.2 Drivers Wanted <br></b>
One or more players on each team must be licensed to drive a car. There is, after all, a whole lot of driving involved when playing this game.  Each driver for a team must be registered with Game Control.  At no time during the game should any individual acting as driver consume alcohol or any drugs proscribed by law.  Violation of this rule will result in immediate disqualification.<br>
<br>
<b>2.3 Click It Or Stick It <br></b>
There must be one seat belt for every occupant of the vehicle. We heartily recommend that you use them.<br>
<br>
<b>2.4 No-Hostage Clause <br></b>
All teams must obey all traffic laws at all times. Teams pulled over for traffic violations will, at Game Control's discretion, be subject to penalization, up to and including disqualification.<br>
<br>
<b>2.5 It's a Van, Not a Viper <br></b>
If you are renting a vehicle for Get-a-Clue, take some time to familiarize yourself with the controls and performance of the vehicle before racing around town with it (but you shouldn't be racing around anyway - see rule 2.4)<br>
<br>
<b>2.6 Trust Us. No Really. We Mean It. <br></b>
We, as Game Control, are not intentionally going to put someone into a position or location where they feel endangered or uncomfortable. If at any point during the game you feel that we may be asking you to risk life, limb, criminal imprisonment, civil liability, your credit rating, or your chance for spiritual salvation, please call Game Control and seek a clarification before proceeding. We may place you in a potentially embarrassing situation, but not a dangerous one.<br>
<br>
<b>2.7 Water Weapons<br></b>
It's been sort of a tradition that teams bring water guns and water balloons along to Get A Clue, to have fun soaking other teams, especially during the opening clue. Teams will be bringing a lot of expensive electronic equipment along with them: laptops, GPS units, iPods, etc. These things don't respond well to getting wet. Paper and books also tend to come out of the experience much the worse for wear. <br>
<br>
The only water weapons allowed are the ones we provide you.<br>
<br>
Teams found to be attacking unarmed players, any member of Game Control, or firing into vehicles will be disqualified - no ifs, ands, or buts. Game Control's decision on this will be final. Additionally, any individual who uses any water weaponry and damages another person's property, they will be legally liable for any damage they incur. <br>
<br>
<b>2.8 Pranks<br></b>
Teams may prank other teams throughout the day. This can be in any creative form, including but not limited to, yelling, taunting, and leaving notes on windshields. Game Control urges that pranksters use common courtesy. If you are unacquainted with the team you intend to prank, do not attempt said prank. Pranks should be limited to friends whom you are certain will find said prank amusing. Do not prank clue packets in any way. This will result in punishment by Game Control based on the outlined rules regarding packets. Do not prank a team in regards to law enforcement. Any team found pranking another team with law enforcement will be summarily disqualified. There are no appeals. This would include, but is not limited to, calling the police on another team, leaving notes that resemble tickets, or yelling anything regarding terrorism. The exception to this rule would be calling the police in the event of an accident or emergency regardless of team involvements. If you are involved in or witness an accident or crime involving another team please call the authorities and notify Game Control immediately.<br>
<br>
<b>2.9 No Hostage Clause - Part 2<br></b>
Local law enforcement agencies have been notified of the occurrence of the game.  If a team has an unfortunate run-in with the Law Enforcement community, they may call and notify Game Control. Teams not at fault for the run-in will be taken off the clock for the length of time it takes to convince Johnny Law that “No, Tech students in a van are not terrorists.” Teams at fault for their run-ins (through tickets, accidents, speeding, vandalism or sheer stupidity) will not be removed from the clock. You did the crime, you pay the time. <br>
<br>
<font size=5><u><b>3. Teams <br></b></u></font>
<br>
<b>3.1 Show Up Prepared <br></b>
All teams and team members must be properly registered, with all appropriate fees paid, before they will be allowed to participate. Please see Section 1 for the rules on registration.<br>
<br>
<b>3.2 You Can Not Do More Damage That Way <br></b>
All members of a team must stay together. You may, of course, split up and run around like idiots upon reaching a clue site to find the clue packet, but you must travel as a group from clue site to clue site. Unless specifically directed by Game Control, splitting into two groups to go to different sites is not allowed.<br>
<br>
<b>3.3 Hang Together, Or Hang Separately<br></b>
All members of a team must utilize a single vehicle while playing Get-a-Clue. You must notify Game Control of any changes to the composition of your team or your choice of vehicle before playing the game. Game Control will permit changes to the composition of your team on a case-by-case basis. <br>
<br>
<b>3.4 Collusion Is Treason <br></b>
Different teams should not share any information with each other. All clues and help clues (and associated material found in clue packets) are given to teams as they need the information and all such information is meant only for that one team. Additionally, any directions, hints, or other help given out over the telephone is highly specialized and is context and time specific. That is to say, what we tell people over the phone will not be helpful to anyone not on that specific team, and may or may not be helpful to them either.<br>
<br>
<font size=5><u><b>4.<br></b></u></font>
<br>
<font size=5><u><b>5. Clues <br></b></u></font>
<br>
<b>5.1 Please Take THIS Section Seriously <br></b>
Clue packets are not to be tampered with in any way. The clue packet must be put back into the same place exactly where you found it. You are ONLY permitted to take out the clue intended for your Team! Any team tampering with packets will be disqualified. With the heightened sense of security following the events of 9-11, we highly recommend that you leave the clue packet exactly as you found it (for you former Scouts, think no-trace camping). Also look for Police before running up to clue packets. If police are spotted in the area and are staking out around the clue packet please inform GC and follow instructions from there.<br>
<br>
<b>5.1.1 We're Not Joking When We Say That, Either <br></b>
Seriously, though. Having an old lady in downtown Atlanta call the police and say that terrorists are outside her house doing Scantron tests and the cops ask if you've got Osama bin Laden hidden in your van is less than fun. DO NOT SCREW WITH THE PACKETS!<br>
<br>
<b>5.1.2 We're Not Cleaning Up After You <br></b>
Under no circumstances should you EVER add anything to the clue packet or the clue site!<br>
<br>
<b>5.2 Authentication is Key<br></b>
After each clue is found, the team must immediately call in to Game Control. This allows us to verify that your team is still on the right route, and also helps us in tracking your team's position and progress during the game. When calling, be sure your give your team name and the appropriate clue identification to Game Control first, before you start complaining.  Also, calling in to confirm your destination will help us keep track of your position.  You are allowed one free call to Game Control for this verification.<br>
<br>
<b>5.3 Tresspassing is a Crime <br></b>
During the game, all clues and clue sites will be easily accessible. You are not allowed to climb fences. Remember, if you have any doubts, you should call Game Control before entering anything that looks like private property.<br>
<br>
<b>5.4 Tread Softly, For You Tread On Our Ass <br></b>
We have had some concerns from the owners and managers who gave us permission to use their property as clue sites, and we will address those concerns here.<br>
<br>
Do NOT Enter a place of business unless you plan to do business, purchase goods, or procure services there. The staff at these locations may not necessarily know anything about the game, and won't be able to help you. <br>
Additionally, Do NOT Disturb plantings or landscaping unnecessarily. Whenever possible, we have tried to put the clue packet in areas close to marked paths, roadways, and sidewalks. Do not go tromping through flowerbeds, since we do not want to piss off any of the nice people who let us use their property. <br>
<br>
We hate to sound like sticklers, but we are trying to accommodate and allay the very reasonable fears of clue site owners. Remember, if you have any doubts, you should call Game Control before entering anything that looks like private property.<br>
<br>
<b>5.5 Clue Support...  You Need It, We Got It... <br></b>
If you get stuck, you may call Game Control for a help clue. Each piece of help has a pre-determined time penalty and will be added to your overall game time if taken.<br>
<br>
<font size=5><u><b>6. Routes <br></b></u></font>
<br>
<b>6.1 We've Plotted This Out <br></b>
Solved clues will lead you from clue site to clue site in a specific, planned order. Each route will be different for each team. Each team will follow the route which they are given and not skip ahead or intentionally follow another team. All clues are guaranteed to be located within 25 miles of the Georgia Tech Campus (specifically, the Couch Building), and only a couple actually reach that boundary.<br>
<br>
<b>6.1.1 Huuhhhuhhuhh...He Said "Cluster" <br></b>
As with previous incarnations of Get-A-Clue, clues will be grouped into "clusters" of 3-5 clues within a geographic region (such as Marietta, Norcross, Midtown, Airport, etc.) Do not assume that all clusters contain the same number of clues, but be cautious of any clue whose apparent solution takes you out of a cluster. See 6.2 for more information.<br>
<br>
<b>6.2 Contrary to Popular Belief, No We Won't Send You to Alabama... <br></b>
If you have doubts as to where a given clue solution will send your team (a side trip to Newnan, or to the state line, for example) then by all means, call Game Control before proceeding. You may have solved the clue incorrectly, or may need additional information. You are permitted one free call to Game Control per clue to verify the answer. Further incorrect confirmation calls will be penalized as one help clue unless Game Control judges extenuating circumstances. Game Control will decide and relay all judgements to the team on the day of the game, so do not bug the operator unless you enjoy bitter, unrelenting sarcasm.<br>
<br>
<b>6.3 Did We Mention Whining Is Treason? <br></b>
Routes for the teams are different, but great care has been taken to equalize the route distances and times. We have made a concerted effort to keep the game both fair and reasonably short. So don't complain.<br>
<br>
<font size=5><u><b>7. Other Very Important Rules <br></b></u></font>
<br>
<b>7.1 Intruders Will Be Shot On Sight <br></b>
The Game Control Building is off limits to all teams at all times. You must be given permission by a member of Game Control before entering the building.  You probably won't find us, anyway.<br>
<br>
<b>7.2 Don't Throw Anything Away <br></b>
Everything that we have given you is vital, in one way or another, to the successful completion of the game. Please try to keep track of what you have been given.  Yes, everything.<br>
<br>
<b>7.3 Why Don't You Call? You Never Call. Are You On Drugs? <br></b>
During the game, you must check in with Game Control at least every two hours. During the normal course of things, you will solve at least one clue during any said two hour period, so this rule will hopefully be redundant. If you are taking additional time with a clue, however (because you want to eat dinner, see a movie, catch a hockey game, hold a secret ceremony, etc.) then please check in with Game Control so that we won't worry. Failure to abide by this WILL result in a time penalty. Continued failure will result in disqualification.<br>
<br>
<b>7.4 Rules Can And Will Mutate <br></b>
You may be given verbal instructions before the game begins or during game play. Any verbal instruction from Game Control has the same weight and force as these rules. In the event of a discrepancy between these rules and what you might be told, do what we tell you to do. Any verbal instruction given to you by Game Control will supercede these rules. Even the one you just read. And the last sentence too. This one as well...<br>
<br>
<b>7.5 No Seriously, Don't Throw ANYTHING Away <br></b>
Keep all clues and envelopes safe. We recommend that you keep them all together in a box or large bag. Game Control reserves the right to ask for anything at the end of the game.<br>
<br>
<b>7.6 Fun Is Mandatory. Unhappiness Is Treason. <br></b>
Remember that this is only a game, and you are meant to be having fun. So have some fun already. Teams failing to have fun within the legal parameters may be penalized.<br>
<br>
<font size=5><u><b>8. Finishing the game<br></b></u></font>
<br>
<b>8.1 The Short-Short Version Of Get-A-Clue <br></b>
Over the course of the day your team will gather clues, solve them to determine clue sites, drive to the clue sites and search for the clue packet, from which you will get your next clue. And you will continue in this manner till you get to the last clue, which will give you the location of a reception to follow the game. The last clue will be clearly identified as such, so there should be no doubts.<br>
<br>
<b>8.2 Scoring & Judgement <br></b>
A winner will be declared at some point after all teams finish the game. Game Control will get around to it as soon as possible, so don't bug us about it. The team which has completed the game in the shortest time, after rest periods and time bonuses are subtracted and time penalties added, is considered to be the Winning Team and all other players should give them your condolences. The team with the second best time will be declared The Real Winners and should be congratulated. The team who finishes last should be chided for being idiots and/or complete smartasses. Even with worst-case time penalties, every team should finish sometime before the decade is out.<br>
<br>
<b>8.3 Start Planning, Suckers <br></b>
The Winning Team is responsible for planning and executing next year's game. Signing the waiver and participating in this year's game constitutes a contract by which you agree to do so.<br>
