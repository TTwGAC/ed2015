In the interest of fairness and accuracy, here is a reasonably accurate history of the game, as told from the meandering memory of Sam "Fireball" Feuer in 2001, updated by Rich Mielke in 2005, Brian Clements in 2006, Adam Churney in 2007, and Roger Barker in 2008.
<hr>
<b>1989: It started as a Pledge Project</b><br><br>
Get-A-Clue had its humble beginnings in Spring 1989 as a brainchild of trombone player and genuine pain-in-Bucky's-side, Jim Tobin. After watching the Disney cult classic Midnight Madness, he thought, "Hey….wouldn't it be cool if we ran a game like that for the band?" At the time, he was pledging Kappa Kappa Psi, and so he brought this idea to Pledge Trainer Brian Hollahan. Brian liked this idea, and so it became the project of that pledge class, the Clueless Officer's Club. Jim later de-pledged, but stayed on to lead the Clueless Officers in the running of that game, called Get A Clue Road Adventure. That first game was well received, although there were a few bugs that were worked out in later years. For one thing, Jim considered trespassing to be all part of the game . . . there were numerous run-ins with security guards, Atlanta's Finest, and other unsavory folk. And thus, the precedent was set. Also in the beginning, routes were assigned for each team before the game was begun. Also, the game started at dusk on Saturday. Despite numerous flaws, much fun was had by most. As one person put it, "Hey, we just spent 10 hours in a car driving around and looking for clues, with only a donut break. Can you imagine how productive we would be if we actually worked like this?" Although only a few teams actually completed all of the clues and made it to the Final Party, the game was begun.<br><br>

Opening Clue: Before the game began, you had to leave your car keys with Game Control, and then go into the Band Lounge for instruction. Then at the start of the game, you were escorted to the big pile of car keys, with the instruction, "Your first clue is somewhere in your car". The clue envelope was located tucked into the driver's sun visor.

<b>1990-1991: After a Hiatus, Get A Clue is Reborn</b>
<br><br>
Despite all of the fun everybody had, there was no game the next year. Get A Clue might have ended, but for the efforts of Ben Cowan. Ben refused to let the game die, so he took it upon himself to bring the game back to life. To get everybody excited again, he ran a Get-A-Clue Lite in Fall 1990 during Band Camp. GAC Lite was an all campus-based game with easy clues to get RATs familiar with the campus and how the game worked. Again, much fun was had by all, and everybody was prepared for Ben's Get Another Clue in Spring of 1991. Get Another Clue featured several new additions to the game, including the use of Greek letters to refer to the clue sites, and the use of permission from shop keepers. Ben also introduced for the first time the concept of Help Clues. Each clue had one help clue that gave some assistance on how to solve the clue or to tell the team where the clue was located. The time value of the help clue was determined after the game, since Game Control was not really sure how many teams were going to have trouble with any of the clues. Again, routes were pre-assigned, and half of the challenge was finding a working pay-phone after each clue site to call in to Game Control. This game came down to a photo finish, with the first two teams finishing within 5 minutes of each other. Since there was confusion as to the values of the help clues, the two teams agreed that the final outcome would officially be declared a tie. Moreover, they agreed to a New Rule: The penalty for "winning" the game was that the team had to be Game Control the following year, so that the game would continue thereafter.
<br> <br>

Opening Clue: Somehow, teams were just sent out staggered every few minutes, probably in order of registration (?)
<hr>
<b>1992: It's a Bad Idea to have Get A Clue the night before a Concert Performance</b>
<br> <br>
And so, we move on to Spring 1992. This game, Get Yet Another Clue, was run by Fireball and contained several of the concepts started with the first two GAC's, including color-coded envelopes for each of the teams, Greek letters to represent the clue sites, and a bag of quarters given to each of the teams to use in the pay phones. The game ran well except for one slight flaw -- routes were unequal for each of the teams. Again, as was the custom, routes were predetermined by Game Control for each of the teams -- at each cluesite, you looked for your team's colored envelopes. Although there was a greater than 100 mile difference between the 1st and 2nd place teams, the first team was declared the winner, and was sentenced to put on the game the next year. The last team to finish called in its last clue at 7:32 in the morning, more than 15 hours after the game started…..and later that afternoon the band had a Masterworks Concert at the brand-new Ferst Center. Needless to say, some people were woken up jussssst in time for the performance. . . . Memorable clues included a periodic table code that led to Fernbank Science Center, following the leader at Georgia State North Metro Campus, the three billy goats gruff on Azalea Drive in Roswell, and of course, Charon, a rowboat, and Lake Allatoona.<br><br>

Opening Clue: Each team was given 20 pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, with "Fireball, Go To Class" written on the back. In the team packets was Fireball's class schedule, with only one location stated, at the Mason Civil Engineering building.
<hr>
<b>1993: Where the @#$& is Spivey Hall?<br><br></b>

The 1993 edition of the game saw a few more innovations, under the leadership of Ted Rathkopf, Melinda McNeal (later married Ted and together moved to Texas), Hans Troemel, Wendy Windsor (later married Hans and together moved to the southwest of town), and a few others. A good attempt was made at balancing the overall mileage of each route, a hub-and-spoke configuration was used to create "clusters" of clues to make said mileage calculations easier, and routes may have been randomized by the order in which teams "solved" the opening clue and raced to the solution. Clues included a tour of the Oglethorpe University campus using quotes from the various buildings, an audiotape clue using the sounds of the underground Hartsfield concourse-to-concourse trains and a locker (back then, you didn't need a ticket to go through security), a skit clue featuring electromagnets and a sword in the stone, invisible ink requiring you to heat the paper, and the infamous Spivey Hall clue. Spivey Hall was not listed in the phone book, nor was it shown on most maps at the time. It was located at Clayton State College (nowadays known as Clayton State University). "Spivey Hall? Isn't that where the Atlanta Symphony plays?" - anonymous teammate of Rich's, uttered at a BP station within one mile of the correct cluesite.
<br><br>
Opening Clue: Game Control had made arrangements with a DJ at WREK-FM to play Alexander's Ragtime Band at a very specific time, as a request for "all you Get-A-Clue people out there" in that hesitant uncertain voice so common to most college radio stations.

<hr>
<b>1994: Team Rambling Root Beer Barrel Polka<br><br></b>

This game was marred somewhat by torrential rains. It featured clues onboard a double-decker bus at Great Gatsby's antiques, at the Concord Covered Bridge west of Smyrna, marching around Underground Atlanta to Coca-Cola sheet music and looking like idiots while several high school proms were taking place nearby, and another skit clue at the home of Brian Hampton's parents based on Costner's Robin Hood movie that was popular at the time, and upon which we had based a halftime show the previous fall.
<br><br>
Opening Clue: Big pinata of Barney hanging from the top of the rehearsal hall, with clue envelopes tucked inside.
<hr>
<b>1995: N'Digo (Nassif!)<br><br></b>

This was a pretty good game in which most of the teams finished at a reasonable hour. One major innovation of this game was the creation of Halftime, a place where teams could rest, eat snacks, and use the bathrooms off the clock. This innovation has disappeared in recent years, but it seemed like a pretty good idea at the time.
<br><br>
Opening Clue: Each game player was given an airline ticket, and after receiving instructions, they were escorted by two lovely stewardesses (Tammy Josephs and Joe Dennison) to their seat -- the entire 2nd floor of Couch was set up as the interior of an airplane. After being served peanuts and cokes, the plane crashed into the water, so hopefully players used their seat cushions as floatation devices, because their clues were located there. Of course, during all that time, Game Control was busy attaching clue envelopes behind the license plates of all of their cars…
<hr>
<b>1996: The Olympics Can Be A Major Payne</b>
<br><br>

Another game with some influence from Ben Cowan, reviver of the game. Clues included tracing various Delta Air Lines routes over a map of the USA to spell out "Rex" (a small village on the southeast side of town), two clues located at Best Buy retailers around town (including a photo of the chess piece towers near Perimeter Mall), the musical American Airlines Baggage clue, and looking up "Yac, G" in the residential pages of the phone book. A skit clue at a southern Gwinnett park included a drill sergeant that would not allow teams to leave until they had performed drills to his satisfaction. Advance preparation by Game Control pays dividends, as does bringing a copy of the Declaration of Independence, as specifically stated in the list of items to bring that year.
<br><br>
Opening Clue: Teams went "camping" in the Couch rehearsal hall, and each team had to name an item they would bring to the campsite. Teams that named an item starting with the same letter as their team name were released and given their clue. Teams failing to pick up on the pattern, were delayed and given their clue a little later.
<hr>
<b>1997: Keep On Getting a Clue (KOGAC)</b>
<br><br>
This was the first year that teams received a random-numbered route, instead of being assigned a route with their color. While this may seem trivial now, it marked a big leap in the running of the game, as nobody could now complain that they were shafted by being given a longer route than others. Unfortunately, most routes turned out to be very long indeed, as routes were presumably balanced within five percent of each other by sending teams back and forth over the top end of I-285 repeatedly - while it was being resurfaced two lanes at a time. Many cluesites consisted of large signs worthy of inclusion at roadsideamerica.com, including Uncle Bud's Catfish in Smyrna (since torn down and relocated), R&R Contractors in Norcross (interesting silhouette), Northwest Exterminators in Smyrna (die, Mothra, die!), and the Bo Phillips Construction Company in Tucker. The puzzles themselves were pretty good, but 400-plus miles of driving was just too much for some teams. 
<br><br>
Opening Clue: Each team participated in a relay race, with a can of Coke as the baton. The last person on the team had to drink the (well shook up) Coke, then bob for their clue in a wading pool.
<hr>
<b>1998: GYAC 98: Team 8-Ball</b>
<br><br>
Opening Clue: "Whooooooooo's Thirsty?" Nowhere in the directions did it say the game started at Couch, yet all but three teams showed up there. And those that did show up at Couch were in for quite a treat: Zeb's AMAZING Magic Show! Mark "Zeb" Szlemko performed tricks of much delight and amazement . . . while those other three teams that went to O'Keefe (as the rules clearly stated) got a good 30 minute start on the game. And after the magic show was over, they closed the doors to Couch, revealing a sign that said, "Hope you enjoyed the show! Now, go read your Rules!" At O'Keefe, there was a memory test (a la Concentration) that you needed to pass to get your first clue.
<hr>
<b>1999: GYAC 99</b>

<br><br>
Opening Clue: Team captains were put in desks in the front of the rehearsal hall, where they were to take a test given on overheads. Throughout the test, certain words were capitalized, spelling out "Pounce The Panther Says Go To The Pool At The School". The first clue was in the diving well at Georgia State.
<hr>
<b>2000: A Briefcase Full of Clues</b>
<br><br>
The 2000 game included the advent of the OHDaMN, a general reference manual for Get A Clue. Cryptography was a huge part of this game, and if not for the manual, most teams could not have finished. This was also arguably the first game in which a strong theme was established. A mix CD was distributed to all teams with part of a clue embedded inside it. A fair number of cluesites were used in earlier games, apparently unbeknownst to Game Control, but the puzzles to get to those sites were very good and innovative. The bead clue was truly amazing but required large numbers of people (or a laptop) in order to finish quickly. Also, this game included the last known example of Halftime, in which Death from Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey played games (to lose, and it showed) such as Tic-Tac-Toe and Hungry Hungry Hippos. 
<br><br>
Opening Clue: Game Control fired water balloons at the team captains using a giant rubber band from a distance of roughly 60 yards. The balloons each contained a small token with the team number on it. Note: balloons lobbed from such a distance HURT.
<hr>
<b>2001: You Don't Know GAC</b>
<br><br>
The 2001 game included a few more innovations, including a SETI T-shirt that was critical to the solution of a clue, mixing various soundbytes together to create CD tracks, recording their own parody of the Sunscreen commencement speech, and more. Also, this may have been the first year for the call-in help clue. If a cluesite was vandalized, clues could be replaced by driving to the nearest Kinko's for a fax. Clues were thoroughly tested on a variety of terrestrial species before being unleashed upon the world. This was probably the first game that stood absolutely no chance of making money, but Game Control probably considered it to be an alumni donation anyway. Clues included the aforementioned SETI, a banner mounted on the side of a building that was only visible from the North MARTA line, washing a fire truck, and placement weaving. The soundtrack included Low Rider, Flamethrower (the line dance song by the J. Geils Band), and The Horse. 
<br><br>
Opening Clue: The game began with a physical challenge. Four members of each team hopped on one long pair of skis steered by ropes, which the teammates held onto. Teams raced across the grounds in front of what was then the Management cluster. The order of finish determined the team's routes.
<hr>
<b>2002: Dead Men Tell No Tales</b>
<br><br>

The first game after 9/11 was a well-run affair, all told. Many teams finished before midnight. After recent nearly-all-night experiences, most teams were shocked to learn that they weren't even in the top five that year. The game contained a strong pirate theme, with many clues beginning with the phrase "Arr, maytees. Your next clue can be found at . . ." which was very useful in decoding efforts. Memorable clues included the Morse-code CD, putting the lime in the coconut, orienteering around the SAC soccer fields, the Westfork clue, and collecting a large number of transparencies that formed a treasure map when fully assembled. The soundtrack included Canyonero from The Simpsons, and Mountain Dew, the tune to which we sing the Baby Seal song. Tampering with clue packets prevented this game from achieving absolute perfection. At the Popeye's Chicken on Piedmont, a team raced out of its van and placed a sticker for Laughing Skull beer on the packet after retrieving their clue. Customers of the Popeye's witnessed this activity, saw the sticker, and called 911. Popeye's management also had failed to notify its employees of the game that day, compounding the problem. Additionally, a clue at Sweetwater Park attracted police attention when a team stapled a pornographic picture to the envelope with the caption "Arrrr, booty". This wouldn't have been so bad except that a four-year-old child saw it. His mother was outraged and called the police. Moral of the story: DO NOT TAMPER WITH THE CLUE PACKETS IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER. We mean it!
<br><br>
Opening Clue: Game Control led teams from registration at the Student Success Center to the campanile (where the sea had magically dried up) to the library fountain. Team representatives sailed raingutter regatta ships (similar to pinewood derby cars) to the center of the fountain by blowing air into the sails, then grabbed a coin from the bottom to determine the team number. The process was accelerated somewhat when Jon Clark belly-flopped into the fountain, creating a tsunami that tossed his ship (and several others) to the center. There be reasons that a change of clothing is frequently recommended by Game Control, ye scurvy dog.
<hr>
<b>2003: Can You Tell Me How To Get To Sesame Street?</b>
<br><br>
The 2003 game was heavily influenced by the Childrens Television Workshop. Each envelope was sponsored by a specific letter-number combination, rather than two pairs of Greek letters, in order to spell out a message at the end of the game. The manual, known as ELMO (Essential Learning Materials for Operation), only contained information essential to the solution of its more difficult puzzles. Six CDs were provided throughout the game: two in the kit with Sesame Street songs (one from the series, one parody), two containing S.O.S. music used for a crossword puzzle, one smiley-faced disc with more music used for another clue (It's Peanut Butter Jelly Time!), and one with a single ten-minute track solely intended for use on that one clue . . . One, ah-ah-ah. Zero, ah-ah-ah. Note to future teams: make sure your CD-player picks up exactly where it left off when you shut your engine off to fill the tank.
<br><br>
Opening Clue: At the rehearsal hall, teams were given a long lecture on various types of numbers, including whole, integer, rational, irrational, prime, etc. Teams were then led to Burger Bowl, where a large number of souvenir frisbees with the GAC 2003 logo were launched at them. Teams had to bring a frisbee with a prime number back to the Couch rehearsal hall to receive their kit and begin the game - the prime number designated the team's route.
<hr>
<b>2004: Literally, GIT A Clue</b>
<br><br>
The 2004 game included a few more innovations, including a game within the game in which teams had to determine who killed Mr. Boddy, with which weapon, and in which room. The soundtrack consisted of four genre-based CDs in the kit, titled "For Those About To Rock", "The Sing Alongs", "Trucks 'n' Beer", and "Driving with Dave." The game itself had some very good clues, but due to the sheer number of them all, the winning team finished after 19 hours around 5 AM the next day, and less than a third finished at all. The game would have featured the first website with the domain name of getaclue, but all combinations had already been reserved. Therefore, the domain name was gitaclue.net, playing on the abbreviation for Georgia Tech. Memorable clues included Morse Code bird calls, Ribs Etc, a 20x20 matrix, 54 Columns, the Communism red herring, and one the majority of teams never saw: the chalk outline at the Midtown MARTA Station. As one team said, "it was two of the best games we ever played."
<br><br>
Opening Clue: The game opened in the auditorium of Wheeler High School in Cobb County, where one member of that year's Game Control earns his living. Scenes from the movie Clue were playing on the screen. At the end, Dan Geist came out, described how the game works, and then the deliverer of a singing telegram was "shot" by the maid (Jennifer Geist) . . . seconds later, the sound effect played. When the victim fell, a large number of envelopes were scattered around the corpse.
<hr>
<b>2005: GIT A Clue 2005</b>

<br><br>
The 2005 game had a strong money and business theme. This can mostly be attributed to (or blamed on) the presence of four MBA students on the previous year's winning team. Being the 16th year (a nice round binary number) since the original Get A Clue Road Adventure, this game paid some small tributes to Get A Clue games of yore, without copying past puzzles. Soundtrack discs bore the titles "Compensation and Benefits Package", "Mileage Reimbursement", "Expense Account", "Executive Washroom", and "Company Historian".
<br><br>
Opening Clue: "In order to ensure fairness to our bidders, the nature of the ferst clue will not be revealed until the opening of the bid packages on April 9th." In other words, to quote Fireball in the 2001 manual, "Wouldn't you like to know?" This led to a multiple-choice test on Tech History within the manual itself. After answering all the questions correctly (thank God for wireless internet), teams were led to the smokestack in Atlantic Station where the first sealed clues were handed out.
<hr>
<b>2006: Get-A-Clue: New World Order</b>
<br><br>
The takeover of the Get-A-Clue franchise by Illuminated Enterprises, Inc. caused many a tremble throughout the GAC universe. The team had placed 4th and 2nd in previous games and finally took the checkered flag in 2005. Luckily, IEI won the right to run the last game before it is old enough to graduate from high school. A middle-aged team (not too old, not too young), IEI looks forward to the challenge of living up to games past and setting a new standard for future games. Soundtracks for this year's game include our strange take on radio shows broadcast throughout the day on WGAC, Get-A-Clue Radio. We still don't know what a fnord is.
<br><br>
Opening Clue: Nffrf, abg ryobjf?
<hr>
<b>2007: Get a Clue <small>2</small>007 License to Clue</b>
<br><br>
The last year the 007 theme was used was 1007.  We have the technology... We can do it better this time.  Based on the Ian Fleming's character James Bond.  You have to ask yourself do you have a License to Clue?  <br><br>

Opening Clue: The website had a binary clue, ciphered with 000 = 0, 007 = 1, telling players to start at the Couch building.  Initial gameday clue led teams on a photo scavenger hunt around campus... for those that bothered to look in the back of the OHDAM.<br><br>

Memorable Clues: The microcontroller that was hidden in a stuffed dog that flashed two (or was it three?) messages in morse code, as well as finding the rapidly decomposed body of 00<FONT FACE="Symbol">p</FONT> after having left him in the trunk just that morning.
<hr>
<b>2008: Get a Clue 2008: Indiana Jones and the Hovitos Idol</b>
<br><br>
It only took us two times of actually gunning for the win (and one less than stellar showing to start), but here we are.  The theme had always been Indy, but for some reason many people were convinced it was Stargate.  We found this amusing and went with it for a while, thus explaining the motivation for the teaser trailer.
<br><br>

Opening Clue: TBD
